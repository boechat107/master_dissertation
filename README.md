# Abstract

This work demonstrates the development and implementation of monitoring and validation
systems for oil well sensors, using machine learning techniques to build data-driven
models of the behaviour of correlated sensors.
These systems are based on the analytical redundancy of the sensors and the main objective
is the calibration drift detection and isolation.
Basically, the validation process is composed of three steps: the prediction of the
sensors values given by the data-driven models, the comparison between the prediction and
the actual sensor value, generating residuals, and, finally, the detection of abnormal
changes in the statistical properties of the residuals.
To verify the applicability of the developed systems, tests with two different datasets
are performed: one dataset generated by the simulation of an oil well model and one
dataset collected from sensors of a real oil well.
Considering the obtained results and the performance metrics adopted, the use of
data-driven models for validation of oil well sensors is promising.
